Using the tools of  Python and SQL, the project aims to gain data analysis insights to bring awareness, create and deliver recommendations, to effectively overcome students achievement issues in two Portuguese Secondary Schools.

## Introduction

The data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por).

## Action Plan

a. Data Selection
b. Data examination and Schema Design
c. Build SQL queries
d. Visualizations and Analysis


## Challenges solved

Apply the rules of normalization while skteching the ERD
Decide which join technique to use
Transforming the dataset
Loading the dataset into the MySQL DB
Data visualization in Python


## Subjects that were addressed during the analysis

### School Performance:	
    In which school does the students have higher performance
    Student's performance vs parents education and job
    Gender distribution

### School Features:	
    Do the school provide support to student (past failures ratio) 
    School with extra-curricular activities have better performance?

### Geographical:	
    How travel time relates to the student performance (Rural or Urban)

### Social:	
    Which school has more students dating and how it effects their performance in the respective subjects? 
    Distribution of students age
    General average alcohol consumption and health status



## Inference:

  The student is the one responsible for itâ€™s grades.
  
  Parents education grade has no relevant correlation with the final grade score.
  
  Average grades should be increased with the enforcement of school policies.
  
  Recommend the increase of school support, in both school, as the number of failures has strict co-relation with the lack of support.
  
  Recommend the forwarding of students with age greater than 19 to academies so they can be prepared for the market.
